<h1 id="introspection-1">Introspection 1</h1>
<p>First. Believe in yourself. Remember that you are building a future
and be part of an organization that's going to shape the way people all
live, and think that, “If someone can be part of 1%, you can too.”
whether the path ahead seems crumbling, challenging, or even the ground
cracks open, or rocks fall from the sky, trust that it will unfold
exactly as you need it to. Do not seek for other people's approval. Have
faith in yourself—just believe in you, only you.</p>
<h1 id="introspection-2">Introspection 2</h1>
<p>Second. Don’t place any value on others' judgments or beliefs about
you. Many people, even those close to you or even family, may try to
elevate themselves by doubting your path, time and efforts. Look them in
the eye, smile, and recognize how small-minded they must be to focus on
saying something about you that they don't really know about without
understanding your journey. Remember, no words you say can change who
they are, so silence is the best response.</p>
<h1 id="introspection-3">Introspection 3</h1>
<p>Third. Picture yourself existing on an environment which does not
allow the growth of individual who aspire to go beyond the norms. Those
around you prefer that you work in a job devoid of passion, performing
monotonous tasks day after day. They wouldn’t care to know about what
your work environment is like. Their sole concern is your ability to
earn money to support them and for them to accept that you have a
“work”. I'm convinced they will cease their demands once you achieve
that.</p>
<h1 id="introspection-4">Introspection 4</h1>
<p>Fourth. It's hard to wait around for something you know might never
happen but it's harder to give up when you know it's everything you
want.</p>
<h1 id="introspection-5">Introspection 5</h1>
<p>Fifth. Once you commit to shifting into a higher reality, the
Universe will conspire in your favor. The right opportunities will
appear, and the right people will show up—but not until you fully commit
to the path. Once you do, that's when the real magic begins</p>
<h1 id="introspection-6">Introspection 6</h1>
<p>Sixth. Everyone you meet always asks if you have a career, are in
relationship or own something as if life was some kind of grocery list
but nobody ever asks if you are okay or are happy.</p>
<h1 id="introspection-7">Introspection 7</h1>
<p>Seventh. To attract better, you have to become better. You can't do
the same things and expect change. Transform your mindset. Upgrade your
habits. Think positive. Be hopeful and consistent with your evolution.
It all starts with you and how you feel about yourself.</p>
<h1 id="introspection-8">Introspection 8</h1>
<p>Eight. Discipline is explaining to your brain that you need to
sacrifice immediate pleasures for greater rewards in the future.</p>
<h1 id="introspection-9">Introspection 9</h1>
<p>Ninth. Some people stop because it's hard, some people start because
it's hard.</p>
<h1 id="introspection-10">Introspection 10</h1>
<p>Tenth. In order to be irreplaceable, one must always be different.</p>
