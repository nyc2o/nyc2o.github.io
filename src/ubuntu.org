* Introduction

I have been using Windows for about 10 years, so switching to a different operating system was a brave move for me. I chose [[https://ubuntu.com/][Ubuntu]] Linux as my new companion. Ubuntu is an open-source operating system based on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian][Debian]]. It is known for its user-friendliness, stability, and wide support community. Ubuntu is used for both personal and professional purposes and is popular for its ease of installation and regular updates.

*  Go to [[https://ubuntu.com/download][Ubuntu]] website

Once you are directed to this site, you will see various OS flavors to choose from based on your needs. I selected the Desktop-use option and the Ubuntu 23.10 version (Mantic Minotaur), which is the 39th Ubuntu release. This is not the Long-Term Support (LTS) version. You can choose according to your preferences, but I recommend opting for the LTS version instead, as it is generally the most stable and secure.

* Create a bootable USB drive to install bare-metal Linux

 Since I want a bare-metal Linux to run a distribution alone on my device; here are the things I did to create a bootable drive using my USB device:

 * Insert =USB flash drive= on the port, make sure that it is clean and must no files.
                     
 * Go and find some application on the internet which makes your USB a boothable one. In my option, I used Rufus; Here is the  [[https://rufus.ie/en/][Rufus Website]] to download the latest version of Rufus 4.4.exe in able to create a bootable USB.
 
 * When the .exe file was downloaded. Open the application and start partitioning your .ISO/image file. See a tutorial on the internet about how to use your downloaded application.

 * Close the app then locate the bootable drive on the disk drives to see if it was successful and ready for distro installation.

*  Boot Process & Installation
 When the bootable USB is ready. Reboot the system and proceed to install the Ubuntu Distro.      
          
 1. I pressed @@html:<kbd>@@Shift@@html:</kbd>@@ before I reboot my system to access the boot manager and chose the bootable device USB which you can see along the process. You have to know what key you should hit to access the book manager of your machine.
                     
 2. You will see installation options; I chose *Install Ubuntu*. Here it will look like:

 3. When I am on the desktop already, there was a =Ubuntu installation pop-up= and after setting up several things, you will see a process for full and default installation.  I clicked the 
 =Full installation of Ubuntu and other options support for additional formats.= The whole installation process took me one hour to finish due to RST and Bitlocker problem. To solve that 
 problem in case you have it, you can see on the other section the solution.
    
* Troubleshooting
 Here are my some of my technical issue during Ubuntu installation process:

** Disable RST or Intel® Rapid Storage Technology

 SOLUTION: 
 On this issue, I restart into Windows again to disable the =RST= on my =UEFI firmware Settings=. After that, I went back again to the installation process and it worked.

** Bitlocker is enabled

 SOLUTION: 
 When I continue to install the Ubuntu when I solved the last issue, I encountered problem again on the process of erasing all my files on disk drive for partitioning. It says that the =bitlocker is enabled=. By that, I went back again on Windows to turn off the bitlocker,  that took me 30 minutes to decrypt the drive to make the installation work for partitioning. I used Powershell commands to view if it's already unlocked. There are tutorials on the internet how to decrypt your  =bitlocker on Windows.=
